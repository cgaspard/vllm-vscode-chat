/**
 * The host environment we hand back to commands the agent runs.
 *
 * `serverManager.buildEnv` pins OpenCode's XDG_* dirs under our private dataDir
 * so this managed instance can never share session/auth/state with a user's own
 * OpenCode install. Those variables are then inherited by every process the
 * agent's `bash` tool spawns — and that silently breaks any XDG-respecting CLI:
 *
 *   - `gh` reads $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gh/hosts.yml to learn which hosts exist
 *     *before* it consults the keychain, so with the pin in place
 *     `gh auth status` reports "not logged into any GitHub hosts" on a
 *     perfectly authenticated machine.
 *   - `helm` relocates HELM_CONFIG_HOME/CACHE/DATA, so repo lists and chart
 *     caches come back empty.
 *
 * The fix is `opencode-plugin/xdg-passthrough.js`, a bundled OpenCode plugin
 * whose `shell.env` hook puts the host's real values back for child processes
 * only. OpenCode reads XDG_* once at startup, so its own isolation is
 * untouched. This module produces the snapshot that plugin consumes.
 *
 * Pure so it is unit-testable without vscode.
