/**
 * OpenCode plugin: give commands the agent runs the host's real XDG_* values.
 *
 * The extension pins XDG_DATA/CONFIG/CACHE/STATE_HOME under its private data
 * dir so the managed OpenCode server can never share state with a user's own
 * install. OpenCode reads those once at startup — but they are also inherited
 * by every process the `bash` tool spawns, which breaks XDG-respecting CLIs
 * (`gh auth status` reports "not logged into any GitHub hosts"; `helm` loses
 * its repo config). Restoring them for children only fixes those tools and
 * leaves OpenCode's own isolation intact.
 *
 * OpenCode builds the shell environment as `{...process.env, ...pluginEnv}`
 * (ShellTool.shellEnv), so writing a key here overrides the pinned value, and
 * writing `undefined` removes it outright — verified against OpenCode 1.18.4
 * that a deleted key is not resurrected by the spawn's `extendEnv: true`.
 *
 * Plain JS with no imports: OpenCode loads this file directly, outside the
 * extension's esbuild pipeline. The env var name below must match
 * `HOST_XDG_ENV` in src/core/hostenv.ts.
